### Instructions

- Put the element with the content in the middle of the page
- Add a white border to the element
- Add the image using the `<img>` element, not `background-image`
- Add elements for first and last name
- Make first and last name appear to be going over the border as in the reference
- Style the rest to your taste

extra task:
- add a quote by your favorite character whose image you used in the previous task
- position the quote to the center beneath the image and make it that when the user scrolls the document, the quote starts scrolling until it touches the top and stays   fixed there.
- add some content enough for a vertical scrollbar to appear
